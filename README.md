# ryuryuBMI
A simple Python script that will tell you your health state by using your BMI

## WARNING
The BMI is only used to <strong>speculate</strong> your overall health.
Thus not counting all the health-related activities (like Workout, Bodybuilding and other...)

## How to use it
It's easy!

All you need is a Command Interpreter (Linux's Terminal or the Windows's CMD) and then type the following line

```
python ryuryuBMI.py [your weight in kg] [your height by m] [/lbs]
```

If you want to use the non-metric formula (weight in lbs). You have to add <i>/lbs</i> at the end of the command line
Since the metric method (weight in kg) would be used by default without it!

## <i>Hey! on what does your BMI measure is based on :angry_emoji</i>
It's based on this chart (found on the following link : https://cansa.org.za/files/2020/02/BMI-table-for-LRAT.jpg)

### The table in question

mine :P

```
python ryuryuBMI.py 75 1.79
```

A fictive one
```
python ryuryuBMI 200 1.65
```

## TODO
* Showing a sort of graphical result by using GUI?
* Triggering a GUI version of it if the user doesn't put any arguments (just by using <i>python ryuryuBMI.py</i>)?
* Making a <i>decent</i> documentation for it...
