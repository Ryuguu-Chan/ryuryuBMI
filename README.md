# ryuryuBMI
A simple Python script that will tell you your health state by using your BMI

# WARNING
The BMI is only used to <strong>speculate</strong> your overall health.
Thus not counting all the health-related activities (like Workout, Bodybuilding and other...)

## How to use it
It's easy!

All you need is a Command Interpreter (Linux's Terminal or the Windows's CMD) and then type the following line

```
python ryuryuBMI.py [your weight in kg] [your height by m]
```

## <i>Hey! on what does your BMI measure is based on :angry_emoji</i>
It's based on this chart (found on the following link : https://cansa.org.za/files/2020/02/BMI-table-for-LRAT.jpg)

### The table in question

## Examples

(mine :P)

```
python ryuryuBMI.py 75 1.79
```

A fictive one
```
python ryuryuBMI 200 1.65
```

## TODO
* Adding the <i>british way to check BMI</i> support
