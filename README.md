# ryuryuBMI
A simple Python script that will tell you your health state by using your BMI

## How to use it
It's easy!

All you need is a Command Interpreter (Linux's Terminal or the Windows's CMD) and then type the following line

```
python ryuryuBMI.py [your weight in kg] [your height by m]
```

## Examples

(mine :P)

```
python ryuryuBMI.py 75 1.79
```

Average fat girl
```
python ryuryuBMI 200 1.65
```

## TODO
* Adding the <i>british way to check BMI</i>port
